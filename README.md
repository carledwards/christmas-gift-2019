# Christmast Gift 2019

For my gift to my kids this year I decided to build them something to keep with them.  It started out as a simple GIF viewer and ended up with something more visually fun/nostalgic.

There are different modes to the display, after startup the user can select a different mode by pressing a pushbutton on the top of the box:

1. GIF Animation - My character drawing is animated while the LED display shows a Happy Face

2. Gaze - A star-like animation on the LED display

3. Worm Race - There are 3 worms that race to the top, the first one to the top wins (then restarts the game)

4. Equalizer - Simulates an audio equalizer

5. Police Scanner - Simulates an LED police scanner

6. Knight Rider - Tribute to Kitt
